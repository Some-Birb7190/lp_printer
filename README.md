<h1>A program to send ESC/POS commands to a usb device</h1>
<p>All this program (./pyprint) does is send out basic ESC/POS commands to a printer connected over usb, with the use of external libraries.<br>
It was made on and is designed for Linux as that is where the problem lay, I couldn't find a unified program to send things out to these printers...so I wrote my own</p><br>

<h2>Pre-Requisites</h2>
<p>For this program, you will need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>pyusb - <a>https://github.com/walac/pyusb</a></li>
    <li>Pillow - <a>https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow</a></li>
    <li>python-qrcode - <a>https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode</a></li>
    <li>pyserial (for serial devices) - <a>https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode</a></li>
    <li>python-barcode - <a>https://github.com/WhyNotHugo/python-barcode</a></li>
    <li>python-escpos - <a>https://github.com/paython-escpos/python-escpos</a></li>
</ul><br>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Clone repository</li>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Run "git clone https://git.birb.not.hpkns.uk/hbirb/lp_printer.git && cd lp_printer"</p></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Install pre-requisites:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><p>You can do this manually by running "pip install pyusb", "pip install Pillow" etc, or run "pip install -r requirements.txt"</p></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Set up environmental variables</li>
    <ul>
        <li><p>First open .env.example and a terminal. Run "lsusb" and find the device you are using. You should have a like that looks like this:<br>
        "Bus 003 Device 085: ID 0416:5011 Winbond Electronics Corp. Virtual Com Port"<br>
        The number before the colon (EG 0416), place that after the "0x" on the line "ID_VENDOR" in ".env.example". The number after the colon (EG 5011) place after the "0x" on the next line down.</p></li>
        <li><p>Then in the terminal, run "lusb -v", this will give a long output so be prepared.<br>
        Find the device that matches the above credentials, and locate the line:<br>
        "bEndpointAddress     0x81  EP 1 IN" and make sure it's the line that says "IN". Place the value after the "0x" (EG 81) and place it after the "0x" in ".env.example", on the line "IN_EP"</p></li>
        <li></p>Next find the line that ends in "OUT", EG:<br>
        "bEndpointAddress     0x03  EP 3 OUT", and place the value after the "0x" (EG 03) on the last line of ".env.example"</p></li>
        <li><p>Finally, remove the ".example" off the end of the file, and you should be good to go</p></li>
    </ul>
    <li>(Optionally) install globally</li>
    <ul>
        <li><p>If you are indeed on a Linux system, then you can install this mini program globally.<br>
        Run "sudo ln -s /path/to/pyprint /usr/local/bin/pyprint && sudo ln -s /path/to/.env /usr/local/bin/.env"<br>
        This will create two symlinks directly to the pyprint program and the .env file. If you move the source files though, the link will break and you will have to redo it.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Follow Usage steps</li>
</ol><br>


<h2>Usage</h2>
pyprint [-h] [-q] [-i] [-b] [-nc] Content

-h  : Displays the help message<br>
-q  : Encodes "Content" inside a QR code and prints it<br>
-i  : Takes a file path from "Content" to an image and print it (gets a bit dodgy with large images)<br>
-b  : Encodes "Content" inside a barcode (CODE128) and prints it. It will also print the encoded text below the code<br>
-nc : Pass to not carriage return and cut the paper after printing<br>
<br>
Content : The file/text you want to be printed/encoded<br>
<br>
<h2>notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>By default, will just print out Content with standard line wrapping</li>
    <li>[-i] and [-q] cannot be passed at the same time, you cannot encode an image in a QR code</li>
    <li>[-i] and [-b] cannot be passed at the same time, you cannot encode an image in a Barcode</li>
    <li>[-b] and [-q] cannot be passed at the same time, you cannot print both off at once</li>
    <li>The max string length for barcodes is 8 characters</li>
    <li>If [-nc] is passed as well as [-q] or [-b], they will both override [-nc] as they require properly finishing the print</li>
</ul>
